# OpenCV and Tesseract.js to Read MRZ

This project uses OpenCV.js to identify the section of the image that contains MRZ. When you have extracted the section containing MRZ (Whether that is the 2 line or 3 line MRZ standard), you pass that along to Tesseract.js to do its OCR magic.

## Getting Started

Just launch this page in a browser, nothing complicated since both OpenCV.js and Tesseract.js are directly referenced in the html file, no bundling.
